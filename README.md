When uLaunch came out I was very excited to try it out, it looks very promising like the design.  
Open source and I guess there will be loads of new features in the future.  


But it's still in beta 0.1 so its not realy stable, not that I found breaking bugs.  
 
 
So I wanted a easy way to remove it and re-install it without re-ftp or sdswap.  
Started my journey in to Switch develepment just this month and I really like the progress I made.  
  
Here are some screenshots:
## Main Menu:

## Download:

Nice progress menu.  
 
## Install complete!

Like the screenshot say's use Reboot Payload to do restart in to uLaunch.
  
## De-Intsall!

## De-Install complete:
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/deinstallcomp.jpg?raw=true). 

Like the screenshot say's use Reboot Payload to do restart in to uLaunch.  
 
## Install Extra Themes!
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/getthemes.jpg?raw=true).  
 
 Themes will appeare directly after closing app in uLauch theme selector.  
 You need to restart uLaunch to apply the theme.  
 Use Reboot Payload to do so.  
 
## In App Update!
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/Update_app.jpg?raw=true).  
 Just restart after download and if there is a new version this one will be started. 
 
## Reboot to Payload!
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/rebootpayloadbox.jpg?raw=true).  

## Homebrew Menu launch icon corrupt.
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/hblaunch.jpg?raw=true).  
  
Like you can see the Icon shows "?" because I used a icon.png and not icon.jpg.  
In uLauch my png icon is showing correct but not in Homebrew Menu
 
 
# Installation:
This is very simple just
download the [DC-uLaunch_Updater.nro](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/raw/master/DC-uLaunch_Updater.nro)  
and create and place in your /switch/Ulaunch-update/ folder.  
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/folder.png?raw=true).  
And then your done.  

# Todo:
- Remove /SDout/ folder after installation. (folder is empty) just need to remove the folder.  
- Give names of references a logic name in the code.
- Decide if will use a png icon or not.
