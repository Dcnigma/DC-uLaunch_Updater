When uLaunch came out I was very excited to try it out, it looks very promising like the design.  
Open source and I guess there will be loads of new features in the future.  
.  
But it's still in beta 0.1 so its not realy stable, not that I found breaking bugs.  
  
So I wanted a easy way to remove it and re-install it without re-ftp or sdswap.
Started my journey in to Switch develepment just this month and I really like the progress I made.  
  
Here are some screenshots:
