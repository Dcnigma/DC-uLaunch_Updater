# DC uLaunch Updater
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/icon.png?raw=true)  
My first real useful homebrew app for the Nintendo Switch.  
Click [here](https://youtu.be/uMz1vgSuQ2g) Video clip showing it in action.  

## uLaunch 0.2 is here!
### Time for updater 0.0.6!
Needed to make a update for v 0.2 new download link.
And test the update function, and yes it needed to be adjust. But its working fine now!
Use the in app update function if you have it or download it from the release

Also updated the skins and no more MACOS__ folders!

## Added offline modes.
Now you can Disable or Enable uLaunch without deleting it.  
Title folders will be moved except for 0100000000001000 only the exefs.nsp file will be moved.

## Uses: 
```this simpel application will.   
- Install/update uLaunch.  
- Remove uLaunch.  
- Install extra Themes.

When uLaunch came out I was very excited to try it out, it looks very promising like the design.  
Open source and I guess there will be loads of new features in the future.  

```
But it's still in beta 0.1 so its not realy stable, not that I found breaking bugs.   
```
 
So I wanted a easy way to remove it and re-install it without re-ftp or sdswap.  
Started my journey in to Switch develepment just this month and I really like the progress I made.  
  
Here are some screenshots:
## Main Menu:

## Download:

## Install complete!

Like the screenshot says use Reboot Payload to do restart in to uLaunch.
  
## De-Intsall!
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/De-install.jpg?raw=true)  
   
## De-Install complete:
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/deinstallcomp.jpg?raw=true) 
This will only De-Install the Titles, not the users information at ''/uLaunch/'' Themes will not be deleted.  
Like the screenshot says use Reboot Payload to do restart in to uLaunch.  
 
## Install Extra Themes!
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/getthemes.jpg?raw=true)  
 Themes will appeare directly after closing app in uLauch theme selector.  
 You need to restart uLaunch to apply the theme.  
 Use Reboot Payload to do so.  

## Disable or Enable uLaunch!  
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/Offlinemodes.jpg?raw=true)  
Disable or Enable uLaunch without deleting it.
Title folders will be moved except for 0100000000001000 only the exefs.nsp file will be moved.  
And as bonus Included all Themes that are in the Showcase.
  
## In App Update!
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/Update_app.jpg?raw=true)  
 Just restart after download and if there is a new version this one will be started. 
 
## Reboot to Payload!
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/rebootpayloadbox.jpg?raw=true)  

## Homebrew Menu launch icon corrupt.
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/hblaunch.jpg?raw=true)  
  
Like you can see the Icon shows "!" because I used a icon.png and not icon.jpg.  
In uLauch my png icon is showing correct but not in Homebrew Menu
 
 
# Installation:
This is very simple just
download the [DC-uLaunch_Updater.nro](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/raw/master/DC-uLaunch_Updater.nro)  
and create and place in your /switch/Ulaunch-update/ folder.  
![alt text](https://github.com/Dcnigma/DC-uLaunch_Updater/blob/master/Screenshots/folder.png?raw=true)

# Warning this is only for Atmosphere CFW!  
Install will not work on other CFW!
Only tested it on my Switch so I don't take responsibility if something happens to your switch.

# Todo:
- Remove /SDout/ folder after installation. (folder is empty) just need to remove the folder. (fixed).   
- Give names of references a logic name in the code.
- Decide if will use a png icon or not.
- Give propper credits to everyone in README.md
- Clean up MACOS_ folders that are created by unzipping. (or upload only cleaned zips)  (fixed use clean zips).
